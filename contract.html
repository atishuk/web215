			<h1>Nastassia Tsishuk</h1>
			<h2>Web 215 Course Contract</h2>
			<p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Nastassia Tsishuk</a> agree to abide by the terms
				of the course contract in my Spring 2021 WEB215-N890: Advantage Markup and Scripting
				with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
			<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will
				be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that
				is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
			<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance,
				not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
			<p>Signed: Nastassia Tsishuk, 16/01/2021</p>
