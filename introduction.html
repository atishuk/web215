			<ul>
				<li><strong>Personal background:</strong> My name is Nastassia Tsishuk. I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus" target="_blank">Belarus</a>; it is a small country in Eastern Europe, between Russia and Poland. I am 34 years old; I am married, and I have two wonderful sons 4 and 6 years old. My family and I moved to the USA in 2017.</li>
				<li><strong>Professional background:</strong> I worked as a design engineer at dump trucks’ enterprise in Belarus. Now, I'm a student and a housewife.</li>
				<li><strong>Academic background:</strong> I have three master’s degrees: an MBA and two in engineering. I have always been interested in programming because when you are working as a software developer, you always need to work using your brain, perfect your skills, and learn new things. When we moved, I decided to change my life radically and start my career from scratch. I began my education at CPCC in spring 2019. I hope to finish it in  spring 2021. So, it is my last semester. I chose the specialty Full Stack Programming because I am interested in Python and Web Markup.</li>
				<li><strong>Background in the subject matter of this course:</strong> I was always interested in web development. 5 years ago, when my elder son was less than one year, I started to learn HTML and CSS with HTML academy, but stopped. Now I decided to continue my education or, better to say, start from scratch it in English(the original language). I finished WEB 110 and WEB 115. WEB 215 is my next step in web development.</li>
				<li><strong>Primary computer platform:</strong> I use Windows 10. I use Windows since Windows 98.</li>
				<li><span><strong>Courses I'm taking and why:</strong> All of these courses are required courses for my program.</span>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="contract.html">WEB-215: Advantage Markup and Scripting</a> - required courses for my program.</li>
						<li>DBA-285: Data Warehousing and Mining - required courses for my program.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Something to Remember Me By:</strong> My first name is Anastasia but, during translation from Belarusian, it became Nastassia.
					Both these names are long and difficult to pronounce, so I prefer Tasia.</li>
					<li><strong>I’d Also Like to Share:</strong> If you want you can add me to your connections on LinkedIn.
						I will be happy to make new connections.</li>
