	<h2>Web 215 Course Contract</h2>
	<p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Nastassia Tsishuk</a> agree to abide by the terms
		of the course contract in my Spring 2021 WEB215-N890: Advantage Markup and Scripting
		with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
	<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will
		be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that
		is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
	<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance,
		not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
